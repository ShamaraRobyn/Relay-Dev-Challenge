About 20 hours spent so far. Runs fine for general use. Testing not yet complete. Uses StyleCop guidelines with this. prefix and no underscore in field names requirements switched off.

To use it, you need to first import the database by executing the InsuranceRulesDB SQL file. Then change the connectionString constant in DBHelper.cs to reflect your host name.

The database is used for storing policy rules and for storing the accepted valid occupations. Its use was designed to act as a refresher for me on the use of Microsoft SQL Server.
